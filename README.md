# ToDoList_Per3
January 19, 2023 
Made this in Python with my partner Maksym. When you hit run, you should see many options. You can then select your option by inputting its corresponding number. The program will then do whatever task you chose. Then it will run again and again until you choose the exit option. With this code, you can not only make a normal To-Do list but also add/remove/cross out anything, organize it alphabetically and many more options.
